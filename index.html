					<li><strong>Description:</strong> 
						Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. 
						In Minecraft, players navigate a blocky, procedurally generated 3D environment of endless terrain and can discover and extract raw materials, craft instruments and objects, 
						and construct buildings or earthworks. Players can battle computer-controlled "mobs" as well as interact with or compete against other players in the same
						environment, depending on the game mode. Game modes include a survival mode in which players need to gain resources to create the globe and preserve health, 
						and an creative mode with infinite resources for players. To build new gameplay elements, objects, and properties, players may change the game.
